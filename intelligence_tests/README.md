# Intelligence Testing Suite

This folder contains comprehensive tests for measuring AGI intelligence and understanding the learning paradox.

## 📊 Test Suite Overview

### Core Intelligence Tests
- **`test_real_intelligence.py`** - Tests AGI on familiar, trained scenarios (achieved 500/500)
- **`test_novel_intelligence.py`** - Tests AGI on completely novel domains (scored 0/500)
- **`analyze_intelligence.py`** - Knowledge graph analysis and pattern recognition tests

### Knowledge Analysis
- **`analyze_current_knowledge.py`** - Analyzes depth vs breadth of current AGI knowledge
- **`learning_paradox_explained.py`** - Explains why months of learning are necessary

## 🧠 The Learning Paradox Discovery

### Current Performance
- **Familiar scenarios: 500/500** (Perfect pattern matching)
- **Novel scenarios: 0/500** (Zero generalization)
- **Conclusion: Memorization ≠ Intelligence**

### What This Reveals
- Our AGI is currently a sophisticated **pattern database**
- It excels at recognizing trained patterns but cannot generalize
- **True intelligence** requires cross-domain reasoning and adaptation

## ⏰ Long-Term Learning Strategy

### Timeline for True AGI
- **Week 1-2:** Pattern recognition (✅ achieved)
- **Week 3-4:** Cross-domain connections emerge
- **Month 2-3:** Causal principles extracted
- **Month 4-6:** True generalization develops
- **Month 6+:** Creative problem-solving emerges

### Success Metrics
- **Month 1:** 500/500 familiar, 100/500 novel
- **Month 3:** 500/500 familiar, 300/500 novel
- **Month 6:** 500/500 familiar, 450/500 novel
- **Goal:** TRUE AGI that generalizes to any domain

## 🔬 Novel Domain Tests

The `test_novel_intelligence.py` script tests completely unseen domains:
- Quantum Computing Cooling Systems
- Blockchain Energy Grid Management
- Neural Interface Brain Monitoring
- Space Elevator Material Stress
- Synthetic Biology Containment

**Current Score: 0/500** - This will improve with months of continuous learning.

## 🚀 Running the Tests

```bash
# Test familiar scenarios (should score 500/500)
python intelligence_tests/test_real_intelligence.py

# Test novel scenarios (currently scores 0/500, will improve over months)
python intelligence_tests/test_novel_intelligence.py

# Analyze current knowledge depth
python intelligence_tests/analyze_current_knowledge.py

# Understand the learning paradox
python intelligence_tests/learning_paradox_explained.py
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### The Core Discovery
**Question:** "What's the point of learning for weeks/months when we get perfect scores in seconds?"

**Answer:** Perfect test scores on trained data ≠ True intelligence
- **Fast learning** → Memorization (what we have)
- **Slow learning** → Understanding (what we need)
- **Time** is not a limitation, it's the essential ingredient for real intelligence

### Why Continuous Learning Matters
- **Robustness:** Handle scenarios never seen before
- **Generalization:** Apply patterns across domains
- **Failure Recovery:** Learn from mistakes and edge cases
- **Intuition:** Develop "gut feelings" from experience
- **Creativity:** Combine patterns in novel ways

## 🎯 The Path to True AGI

This testing suite will track the AGI's progress from:
- **Current State:** Advanced pattern matcher (500/500 familiar, 0/500 novel)
- **Target State:** True general intelligence (500/500 familiar, 450+/500 novel)

The journey requires patience - we're growing a mind, not programming a database.

*"True intelligence is not about perfect memory or pattern matching, but about flexible reasoning and adaptation to completely new scenarios."*

## 🧪 Testing Tools

### 1. Knowledge Graph Analysis (`analyze_intelligence.py`)

**Purpose**: Quantifies the scale and sophistication of learned knowledge

**Usage**:
```bash
python analyze_intelligence.py
```

**What it measures**:
- **Knowledge Scale**: Total entities and relationships in the knowledge graph
- **Reasoning Depth**: Multi-hop reasoning chains (1-5 relationship hops)
- **Knowledge Confidence**: High-confidence vs exploratory learning patterns
- **Network Topology**: Hub entities and knowledge interconnectedness

**Sample Output**:
```
🧠 ICA Framework Intelligence Analysis
📊 Knowledge Scale: 93,449 entities | 205,891 relationships  
🔍 Multi-hop reasoning chains: 45,219 paths discovered
🎯 High-confidence knowledge: 31,204 entities (33.4%)
🔗 Hub entities: 156 concepts with 50+ connections
📈 Average reasoning depth: 2.8 relationship hops
```

**Interpretation**:
- **< 10K entities**: Early learning phase
- **10K-50K entities**: Basic intelligence emerging
- **50K-100K entities**: Competent knowledge acquisition
- **> 100K entities**: Advanced intelligence threshold
- **> 3.0 avg hops**: Strong multi-step reasoning capability

## 🚀 Best Practices for Testing

### 1. Run After Learning
For meaningful results, test after the AGI has learned for several hours:

```bash
# Start continuous learning
python run_continuous.py

# Let it run for 2+ hours, then stop with Ctrl+C

# Run intelligence tests
python intelligence_tests/analyze_intelligence.py
python intelligence_tests/test_real_intelligence.py
```

### 2. Progressive Testing
Test periodically to track intelligence growth:

```bash
# Initial baseline (after 30 minutes)
python intelligence_tests/analyze_intelligence.py

# Growth check (after 2 hours)  
python intelligence_tests/analyze_intelligence.py

# Maturity test (after 8+ hours)
python intelligence_tests/test_real_intelligence.py
```

### 3. Database Requirements
Both tools require:
- **Neo4j database** running and configured
- **Existing knowledge graph** from ICA Framework learning
- **Proper database connection** (configured via `python setup.py database`)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Dependencies
Both tools require the same dependencies as the main ICA Framework:
- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j database
- ICA Framework installed (`pip install -e .`)

### Data Source
Tests analyze the Neo4j knowledge graph created by:
- `run_continuous.py` (recommended for comprehensive testing)
- `examples/learning.py` (basic testing possible)

### Honest Assessment Philosophy
These tools provide **realistic intelligence assessment** rather than inflated metrics. The scoring is designed to:
- Reward genuine capabilities
- Penalize superficial pattern matching
- Provide actionable feedback for improvement
- Set realistic expectations for AGI development
