## 🚫 Breaking Learning Plateaus

When AGI hits learning plateaus (like at 10k steps with flatlined metrics):

### Plateau Detection
```
Your AGI hit a learning plateau! This is common in AI training.
📊 Concepts: 5.8M (stopped growing)
🧪 Hypotheses: 2,800 (no new formations)
⚡ Simulation steps: Nearly zero activity
```

### Solutions to Resume Learning
1. **Restart with fresh exploration**: `python scripts/run_continuous.py --reset-exploration`
2. **Lower learning rate**: Modify `gpu_config.py` learning parameters
3. **Add new domains**: Expand beyond physics to chemistry, biology
4. **Increase model capacity**: Scale up neural network architectures

## 🛡️ Neural Network Protection

**Zero Training Loss Guarantee** - Your billion-parameter models are protected:

1. **Auto-Save**: Every 2 minutes during training
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Ctrl+C triggers safe model saving
3. **Emergency Backup**: Direct neural save if regular save fails
4. **Session Restoration**: Perfect weight restoration across restarts

```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Intelligence Tests Failing:**
- Ensure AGI has been trained first: `python scripts/run_continuous.py`
- Check for model files in `agi_checkpoints/agi_session_*/models/`
- Verify GPU memory (4GB+ required for billion-parameter inference)

**Learning Plateau Issues:**
- Check W&B dashboard for flatlined metrics
- Monitor `intelligence_history.json` for stagnant scores
- Implement plateau-breaking solutions above

**W&B Authentication:**
- Run `wandb login` and follow prompts
- System works offline, syncs when connection restored

**GPU Performance:**
- System auto-detects and configures GPU
- Billion-parameter models require CUDA for reasonable performance
