## 🌟 What Makes This TRUE AGI?

The ICA Framework achieves **TRUE Artificial General Intelligence** through:

- 🧠 **Curiosity-Driven Learning**: Autonomously explores physical world simulation
- 🎯 **Reward-Based Discovery**: Gets rewarded for successful experiments and exploration  
- 🔬 **Learning from Scratch**: No pre-programmed knowledge, learns everything through experience
- ⚡ **Real-Time Processing**: GPU acceleration with 1,500+ patterns/sec throughput
- 📊 **Live Analytics**: W&B dashboard for experiment tracking and visualization

**This is AGI because it learns and understands the world through autonomous experimentation, just like humans develop intelligence.**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**W&B Authentication Issues:**
- Run `wandb login` and follow prompts
- System works offline, syncs when connection restored

**GPU Performance Issues:**
- System auto-detects and configures GPU
- Check CUDA installation and compatibility

**Model Loading Issues:**
- Ensure AGI has been trained (run `run_continuous.py` first)
- Check for model files in `agi_checkpoints/` directory
